LZ4_compress() :
    Compresses 'inputSize' bytes from 'source' into 'dest'.
    Destination buffer must be already allocated,
    and must be sized to handle worst cases situations (input data not compressible)
    Worst case size evaluation is provided by function LZ4_compressBound()
    inputSize : Max supported value is LZ4_MAX_INPUT_VALUE
    return : the number of bytes written in buffer dest
             or 0 if the compression fails

LZ4_decompress_safe() :
    compressedSize : is obviously the source size
    maxOutputSize : is the size of the destination buffer, which must be already allocated.
    return : the number of bytes decoded in the destination buffer (necessarily <= maxOutputSize)
             If the destination buffer is not large enough, decoding will stop and output an error code (<0).
             If the source stream is detected malformed, the function will stop decoding and return a negative result.
             This function is protected against buffer overflow exploits :
             it never writes outside of output buffer, and never reads outside of input buffer.
             Therefore, it is protected against malicious data packets.
