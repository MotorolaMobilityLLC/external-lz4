/*
LZ4_singleThread_compress :
	Same as LZ4_compress, but avoids re-allocation effect between each call.
	Better performance, but only use it in single-threading scenario !
	note : performance difference is only noticeable when repetitively calling the compression algorithm on many small data packets.

LZ4_compressCtx :
	This function explicitly handle the CTX memory structure.
	It avoids allocating/deallocating memory between each call, improving performance.

	On first call : provide a *ctx=NULL; It will be automatically allocated.
	On next calls : reuse the same ctx pointer.
	Use different pointers for different threads when doing multi-threading.

	note : performance difference is only noticeable when repetitively calling the compression algorithm on many small data packets.
